## Understanding Software Licenses

Software licenses are essential in defining how software can be used, modified, and distributed. This guide will help you understand different types of software licenses and when to use them.

### 1. Proprietary Licenses
**Usage:** Ideal for retaining full control and monetizing your software.

**Examples:**
- **Microsoft Office:** For productivity software with controlled distribution and updates.
- **Adobe Photoshop:** Professional graphic design software available via subscription.

### 2. Free Software Licenses
**Usage:** Provides users freedom to use, modify, and share software, with varying restrictions.

#### a. Permissive Licenses
**Usage:** Encourages widespread use and contributions with minimal restrictions.

**Examples:**
- **MIT License:** Used by web frameworks like **React** and **Angular**.
- **Apache License 2.0:** Applied in projects like **Apache Hadoop** and **Kubernetes**.
- **BSD License:** Utilized in systems like **FreeBSD** and **OpenBSD**.

#### b. Copyleft Licenses
**Usage:** Ensures all derivative works remain open and free.

**Examples:**
- **GNU General Public License (GPL):** Employed by projects like **Linux** and **WordPress**.
- **GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL):** For libraries like **GNU C Library (glibc)**.
- **Affero General Public License (AGPL):** Used for network server software like **MongoDB**.

### 3. Open Source Licenses
**Usage:** Opens the source code for public use, modification, and distribution, sometimes with conditions.

**Examples:**
- **MIT License:** Commonly used across various projects.
- **Apache License 2.0:** Preferred for patent protection.
- **GPL License:** Ensures all derivatives remain free and open.

### 4. Creative Commons Licenses
**Usage:** Ideal for non-software works, software documentation, educational materials, and multimedia.

**Examples:**

- **CC BY-NC (Attribution-NonCommercial):** For non-commercial use.

### 5. Public Domain
**Usage:** Relinquishes all rights, allowing unrestricted use, modification, and distribution.

**Examples:**

### 6. Dual Licensing
**Usage:** Offers the same software under different licenses for varied user needs.

**Examples:**
- **MySQL:** Available under GPL for open source use and a commercial license.
- **Qt Framework:** Offers both open source (GPL or LGPL) and commercial licenses.

### 7. Proprietary Freeware
**Usage:** Free to use software, but with controlled distribution and modification rights.
