# Dev ‚Üí Main Workflow: Professional Team Development

## üéØ Real-World Scenario
You're part of a 5-person development team building a web application. Here's how professional teams manage the development ‚Üí main branch workflow daily.

---

## üè¢ **Professional Team Setup**

### **Branch Strategy:**
```bash
main          # Production-ready code (protected)
develop       # Integration branch for features  
feature/*     # Individual feature development
hotfix/*      # Emergency production fixes
release/*     # Release preparation
```

### **Team Roles:**
- **Developer**: Creates features, fixes bugs
- **Tech Lead**: Reviews code, makes architecture decisions  
- **DevOps**: Manages deployments, CI/CD
- **QA**: Tests features, validates releases

---

## üöÄ **Daily Development Workflow**

### **Morning Routine (5 mins)**
```bash
# 1. Sync with latest changes
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# 2. Check what's happening
git log --oneline -5
git branch -a

# 3. Clean up merged branches
git branch --merged | grep -v develop | xargs git branch -d
```

### **Starting New Feature (2 mins)**
```bash
# Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop  # Always sync first!
git checkout -b feature/user-profile-editing

# Push branch immediately (backup + visibility)
git push -u origin feature/user-profile-editing
```

### **Daily Development (Throughout day)**
```bash
# Regular commits with good messages
git add .
git commit -m "Add profile form validation

- Email format validation with regex
- Password strength requirements  
- Real-time validation feedback
- Unit tests for validation functions"

# Push regularly (don't lose work!)
git push origin feature/user-profile-editing
```

---

## üîÑ **Feature Completion Workflow**

### **Step 1: Pre-PR Checklist (10 mins)**
```bash
# 1. Sync with develop (important!)
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout feature/user-profile-editing
git rebase develop  # or: git merge develop

# 2. Run all tests
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build

# 3. Clean up commit history (optional)
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Squash small commits

# 4. Final push
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/user-profile-editing
```

### **Step 2: Create PR (5 mins)**
```markdown
## üé® Add User Profile Editing

**What**: Users can now edit their profile information including avatar, name, email, and bio.

**Why**: Top requested feature from user feedback (Issue #245)

**How**: 
- Built React form with real-time validation
- Added profile image upload with resize
- Integrated with user API endpoints
- Added comprehensive error handling

**Testing**:
- ‚úÖ Unit tests: 15 new tests added
- ‚úÖ Integration tests: Profile flow tested
- ‚úÖ Manual testing: All browsers tested
- ‚úÖ Accessibility: Screen reader tested

**Screenshots**: 
[Before/after images of profile page]

**Closes**: #245
**Related**: #156, #203
```

### **Step 3: Code Review Process (1-2 days)**
```bash
# Team members review your code
# Address feedback professionally:

# Make requested changes
git checkout feature/user-profile-editing
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "Address code review feedback

- Extract validation logic to separate hook
- Add TypeScript types for profile data
- Improve error message accessibility
- Add missing unit test for edge case"

git push origin feature/user-profile-editing
```

---

## üöÄ **Merge & Deploy Process**

### **Step 1: PR Approval & Merge**
```bash
# After 2+ approvals, tech lead merges PR
# Merge options:
# - "Squash and merge" (clean history)
# - "Merge commit" (preserve branch history)
# - "Rebase and merge" (linear history)

# Auto-delete feature branch after merge
```

### **Step 2: Develop ‚Üí Main (Release Process)**
```bash
# When ready for release (usually weekly/bi-weekly):

# 1. Create release branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v1.4.0

# 2. Final preparations
echo "1.4.0" > VERSION
git add VERSION
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.4.0"

# 3. Merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-ff release/v1.4.0
git tag -a v1.4.0 -m "Release version 1.4.0"

# 4. Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/v1.4.0

# 5. Push everything
git push origin main
git push origin develop  
git push origin --tags

# 6. Clean up
git branch -d release/v1.4.0
```

---

## üö® **Hotfix Workflow (Emergency!)**

### **Critical Bug in Production**
```bash
# 1. Create hotfix from main (not develop!)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/security-patch-login

# 2. Fix the critical issue
# ... make minimal, focused fix ...
git add .
git commit -m "URGENT: Fix SQL injection vulnerability in login

- Sanitize user input in authentication endpoint
- Add parameterized queries for all user data
- Tested against common injection attacks

Fixes security issue reported privately"

# 3. Test thoroughly
npm test
npm run security-audit

# 4. Merge to main immediately
git checkout main  
git merge --no-ff hotfix/security-patch-login
git tag -a v1.4.1 -m "Hotfix: Security patch"

# 5. Merge to develop too
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff hotfix/security-patch-login

# 6. Deploy ASAP
git push origin main
git push origin develop
git push origin --tags
```

## üéØ **Real-World Team Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Conflicting Features**
```bash
# Two developers working on related features
# Developer A: Working on user authentication
# Developer B: Working on user profile

# Solution: Regular communication + frequent syncing
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase develop  # Do this 2-3 times per week
```

### **Scenario 2: Failed CI/CD**
```bash
# Your PR fails automated tests
# Don't merge until green ‚úÖ

# 1. Check CI logs
# 2. Fix issues locally
git checkout feature/my-feature
# ... fix test failures ...
git add .
git commit -m "Fix failing unit tests in CI"
git push origin feature/my-feature

# 3. Wait for green build, then merge
```

### **Scenario 3: Emergency Rollback**
```bash
# Production deployment broke something
# Quick rollback process:

# 1. Revert the problematic merge commit
git checkout main
git revert -m 1 abc123d  # Revert merge commit
git push origin main

# 2. Deploy previous version
# 3. Investigate and fix properly in develop
```

## ‚ö° **Daily Team Practices**

### **Morning Standup Integration**
```bash
# What you did yesterday:
"Completed user authentication feature, PR is ready for review"

# What you'll do today:  
"Working on profile editing, will rebase with develop changes"

# Any blockers:
"Waiting for API changes from backend team"
```

### **End-of-Day Routine**
```bash
# Always push your work
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: Profile form styling - 70% complete

Still need to:
- Add responsive breakpoints
- Fix Safari layout issue  
- Add loading states"
git push origin feature/user-profile-editing

# Update project board
# Move your task from "In Progress" to "Ready for Review"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Branch Protection Rules**

### **Main Branch Protection:**
```yaml
# GitHub Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí main
‚úÖ Require pull request reviews (2 reviewers)
‚úÖ Dismiss stale reviews when new commits pushed
‚úÖ Require status checks to pass
‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date
‚úÖ Include administrators
‚úÖ Restrict pushes (only through PRs)
```

### **Develop Branch Protection:**
```yaml
# GitHub Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí develop  
‚úÖ Require pull request reviews (1 reviewer)
‚úÖ Require status checks to pass
‚úÖ Allow force pushes (for rebasing)
```

---

## üìä **Automation & CI/CD Integration**

### **Automated Workflows:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/feature-branch.yml
name: Feature Branch CI
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [develop]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Tests
        run: |
          npm install
          npm test
          npm run lint
          npm run build
          
  deploy-preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy Preview
        run: ./deploy-preview.sh
        env:
          BRANCH_NAME: ${{ github.head_ref }}
```

### **Deployment Pipeline:**
```bash
# Automatic deployments:
develop branch ‚Üí staging environment
main branch ‚Üí production environment

# Manual deployments:
feature branches ‚Üí preview environments (for testing)
```

## üéØ **Common Team Challenges & Solutions**

### **Challenge: Merge Conflicts**
```bash
# Solution: Regular syncing
git checkout feature/my-feature
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/develop  # Do this daily!
```

### **Challenge: Large Feature Development**
```bash
# Solution: Break into smaller PRs
# Instead of 1 massive PR:
feature/user-system

# Create multiple focused PRs:
feature/user-authentication  
feature/user-profile
feature/user-preferences
feature/user-settings
```

### **Challenge: Code Review Bottlenecks**
```bash
# Solutions:
- Smaller PRs (< 400 lines changed)
- Clear PR descriptions  
- Self-review before requesting review
- Review others' PRs promptly
- Pair programming for complex changes
```

---

## üí° **Pro Tips for Team Success**

### **1. Communication is Key**
```bash
# Good practices:
- Comment on complex code
- Explain architectural decisions
- Ask questions when unsure
- Share knowledge in PR descriptions
```

### **2. Consistent Code Quality**
```bash
# Team standards:
- Same linting rules (.eslintrc)
- Same formatting (.prettierrc) 
- Code review checklist
- Automated testing requirements
```

### **3. Documentation**
```bash
# Keep updated:
- README.md (setup instructions)
- API documentation
