## üéØ Learning Goals
By the end of this lesson, you'll understand:
- The difference between GitHub Flow and Git Flow
- When to use each workflow
- How to implement both workflows effectively
- Choosing the right workflow for your team
- Best practices for team collaboration

---

## üåä What are Git Workflows?

**Git workflows** are branching strategies that teams use to organize their development process. They provide:
- **Structure** for how features are developed
- **Rules** for when and how to merge code
- **Process** for releasing software
- **Coordination** between team members

### Popular Workflows
1. **GitHub Flow** - Simple, web-focused workflow
2. **Git Flow** - Feature-rich workflow for complex releases
3. **GitLab Flow** - Combines simplicity with environment-specific branches
4. **Forking Workflow** - Best for open source projects

---

## üöÄ GitHub Flow

**GitHub Flow** is a lightweight, branch-based workflow perfect for teams that deploy frequently.

### Core Principles
```
Main branch ‚Üí Always deployable
Feature branches ‚Üí Short-lived, focused changes
Pull Requests ‚Üí Code review and discussion
Deploy ‚Üí From main branch frequently
```

### The GitHub Flow Process

#### Step 1: Create a Branch
```bash
# Always branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
```

#### Step 2: Add Commits
```bash
# Make focused commits
git add .
git commit -m "Add login form component"
git commit -m "Implement password validation"
git commit -m "Add authentication API integration"
```

#### Step 3: Open Pull Request
- Create PR early (even as draft)
- Describe changes clearly
- Request specific reviewers
- Link to related issues

#### Step 4: Discuss and Review
- Team reviews code
- Automated tests run
- Make changes based on feedback
- Get approval from reviewers

#### Step 5: Deploy
```bash
# Deploy from feature branch for testing (optional)
# Or deploy after merge to main
```

#### Step 6: Merge
```bash
# Merge to main after approval
# Delete feature branch
git branch -d feature/user-authentication
```

### GitHub Flow Example

```bash
# Day 1: Start new feature
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/shopping-cart

# Work on feature
echo "Shopping cart implementation" > cart.js
git add cart.js
git commit -m "Add basic shopping cart functionality"
git push -u origin feature/shopping-cart

# Create PR immediately for early feedback
# Continue working based on reviews

# Day 3: Feature ready
git push origin feature/shopping-cart
# Merge PR after approval
# Deploy to production
```

### When to Use GitHub Flow
‚úÖ **Perfect for:**
- Web applications with continuous deployment
- Small to medium teams
- Projects with frequent releases
- Teams comfortable with main-branch deployment
- Simple, straightforward projects

‚ùå **Not ideal for:**
- Projects with scheduled releases
- Multiple version maintenance
- Complex integration requirements
- Teams needing extensive QA processes

---

## üå≥ Git Flow

**Git Flow** is a more complex workflow designed for projects with scheduled releases and multiple environment support.

### Core Branches
1. **main/master** - Production-ready code
2. **develop** - Integration branch for features
3. **feature/** - Individual feature development
4. **release/** - Preparing new releases
5. **hotfix/** - Critical production fixes

### Git Flow Diagram
```
    main     ‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè  (production releases)
             ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ
   hotfix   ‚ï±‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè‚ï± ‚ï±‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè‚ï±   (emergency fixes)
           ‚ï±     ‚ï± ‚ï±     ‚ï±
  develop ‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè     (integration)

 feature/ ‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè ‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè ‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè     (features)
```

### Git Flow Process

#### Feature Development
```bash
# Start new feature from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/payment-integration

# Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "Add payment form"
git commit -m "Integrate with payment API"

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/payment-integration
git branch -d feature/payment-integration
git push origin develop
```

#### Release Process
```bash
# Start release branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0

# Final preparations (version bumps, bug fixes)
echo "version = '1.2.0'" > version.py
git add version.py
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.2.0"

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff release/v1.2.0
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/v1.2.0

# Clean up
git branch -d release/v1.2.0
```

#### Hotfix Process
```bash
# Critical bug in production
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/security-patch

# Fix the issue
git add .
git commit -m "Fix security vulnerability in login"

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff hotfix/security-patch
git tag -a v1.2.1 -m "Hotfix version 1.2.1"

# Merge to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff hotfix/security-patch

# Clean up
git branch -d hotfix/security-patch
```

### Using Git Flow Tools

```bash
# Install git-flow extension
# macOS: brew install git-flow
# Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install git-flow

# Initialize git flow
git flow init

# Start feature
git flow feature start payment-integration

# Finish feature
git flow feature finish payment-integration

# Start release
git flow release start 1.2.0

# Finish release
git flow release finish 1.2.0

# Start hotfix
git flow hotfix start security-patch

# Finish hotfix

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementing Team Workflows

### Setting Up GitHub Flow

#### 1. Repository Configuration
```bash
# Protect main branch
# Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Branches
# Add rule for main branch:
# ‚úì Require pull request reviews
# ‚úì Dismiss stale reviews
# ‚úì Require status checks
# ‚úì Require branches to be up to date
# ‚úì Include administrators
```

#### 2. Team Guidelines
```markdown
## GitHub Flow Team Rules

1. **Main branch is always deployable**
   - Never commit directly to main
   - All changes go through Pull Requests
   - Automated tests must pass

2. **Feature branches are short-lived**
   - Create from main
   - Focus on single feature/bug fix
   - Delete after merging

3. **Pull Request process**
   - Create early, even as draft
   - Request at least 1 reviewer
   - Address feedback promptly
   - Squash commits if many small ones

4. **Deployment**
   - Deploy from main branch
   - Monitor deployments
   - Rollback if issues detected
```

#### 3. Automation Setup
```yaml
# .github/workflows/main.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
  
  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to production
      run: ./deploy.sh
```

### Setting Up Git Flow

#### 1. Branch Protection Rules
```bash
# Protect both main and develop branches
# Main: Only release and hotfix merges allowed
# Develop: Only feature and release merges allowed
```

#### 2. Team Guidelines
```markdown
## Git Flow Team Rules

1. **Branch Usage**
   - main: Production code only
   - develop: Integration of features
   - feature/*: Individual feature development
   - release/*: Release preparation
   - hotfix/*: Production emergency fixes

2. **Feature Development**
   - Branch from develop
   - Merge back to develop with --no-ff
   - Delete feature branch after merge

3. **Release Process**
   - Create release branch from develop
   - Final testing and bug fixes only
   - Merge to both main and develop
   - Tag main with version number

4. **Hotfix Process**
   - Branch from main
   - Merge to both main and develop
   - Tag with patch version
```

## üéØ Best Practices for Team Workflows

### 1. Communication
```markdown
‚úÖ **Good Communication**
- Clear commit messages
- Descriptive PR titles and descriptions
- Regular team sync meetings
- Document workflow decisions

‚ùå **Poor Communication**
- Vague commit messages ("fix stuff")
- Empty PR descriptions
- Working in isolation
- Undocumented process changes
```

### 2. Code Quality
```bash
# Set up automated checks
- Linting (ESLint, Prettier, etc.)
- Testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Security scanning
- Code coverage requirements

# Example: package.json scripts
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint src/",
    "test": "jest",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
    "security": "npm audit"
  }
}
```

### 3. Documentation
```markdown
## Required Documentation

### For the Team
- Workflow choice and reasoning
- Branch naming conventions
- PR review process
- Deployment procedures
- Emergency procedures

### For New Team Members
- Setup instructions
- Development workflow
- Code style guidelines
- Review checklist
- Common problems and solutions
```
