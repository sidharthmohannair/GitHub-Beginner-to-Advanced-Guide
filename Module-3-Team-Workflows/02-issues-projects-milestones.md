## üé´ GitHub Issues

**GitHub Issues** are the foundation of project management on GitHub. Think of them as tickets in a help desk system.

### What Are Issues Good For?
- **Bug Reports**: Document problems in your code
- **Feature Requests**: Propose new functionality  
- **Tasks**: Track work that needs to be done
- **Questions**: Ask for help or clarification
- **Discussions**: Brainstorm ideas with your team

### Creating Effective Issues

## üìã GitHub Projects

**GitHub Projects** provide kanban-style boards for organizing and tracking work across issues and pull requests.

### Project Types

#### Repository Projects
- Attached to a single repository
- Good for smaller projects
- Easier to set up and manage

#### Organization Projects  
- Can span multiple repositories
- Good for larger initiatives
- More complex setup but more powerful

### Setting Up a Project

#### 1. Create New Project
1. Go to repository ‚Üí Projects tab ‚Üí New project
2. Choose template:
   - **Basic kanban**: Simple To do/In progress/Done
   - **Automated kanban**: Auto-moves cards based on PR status  
   - **Automated kanban with reviews**: Includes review columns
   - **Bug triage**: Optimized for bug management

#### 2. Customize Columns
```
üìù Backlog      ‚Üí Ideas and future work
üèÉ To Do        ‚Üí Ready to start  
‚ö° In Progress  ‚Üí Currently being worked on
üëÄ In Review    ‚Üí PRs waiting for review
‚úÖ Done         ‚Üí Completed work
```

#### 3. Add Cards
- **Create issues** directly from project board
- **Add existing issues** by dragging from issues tab
- **Add pull requests** to track development progress
- **Add notes** for quick tasks that don't need full issues

### Project Automation

#### Automated Actions
```markdown
## Built-in Automations

### To do column
- Newly added issues ‚Üí Move here
- Reopened issues ‚Üí Move here

### In progress column  
- Issues assigned ‚Üí Move here
- PRs opened ‚Üí Move here

### In review column
- PRs ready for review ‚Üí Move here

### Done column
- Issues closed ‚Üí Move here
- PRs merged ‚Üí Move here
```

#### GitHub Actions for Projects
```yaml
# .github/workflows/project-automation.yml
name: Move issues to project board

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, assigned]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, ready_for_review]

jobs:
  move-to-project:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: alex-page/github-project-automation-plus@v0.8.1
        with:
          project: Development Board
          column: To Do
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Project Best Practices

<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
- **Issues**: Individual work items (bugs, features, tasks)
- **Projects**: Organizational boards that group and track multiple issues
- Issues are the "what", Projects are the "how we organize and track"
</details>

**Question 2**: When should you create a Milestone?
<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
Create milestones for:
- Software releases (v1.0, v2.0)

- Project phases (Design, Development, Testing)
- Time-bound objectives (quarterly goals)
</details>

**Question 3**: How do you automatically close an issue with a PR?
<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
Use keywords in the PR description:
- "Closes #123"
- "Fixes #123"  
- "Resolves #123"
