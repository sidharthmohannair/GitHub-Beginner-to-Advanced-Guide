## üè∑Ô∏è Label Management

Labels help categorize and prioritize issues and pull requests effectively.

### Essential Label Categories

#### 1. Type Labels
```bash
# What kind of work is this?
type:bug          # Something isn't working
type:feature      # New functionality  
type:enhancement  # Improve existing feature
type:docs         # Documentation changes
type:refactor     # Code cleanup/restructure
type:test         # Testing related
type:chore        # Maintenance tasks
```

#### 2. Priority Labels
```bash
priority:critical  # Drop everything and fix
priority:high      # Important, should be next
priority:medium    # Normal priority
priority:low       # Nice to have
```

#### 3. Status Labels
```bash
status:blocked       # Cannot proceed
status:in-progress   # Currently being worked on
status:needs-review  # Ready for code review
status:needs-info    # Waiting for more information
status:duplicate     # Duplicate of another issue
status:wontfix       # Won't be addressed
```

#### 4. Area Labels
```bash
area:frontend    # User interface
area:backend     # Server-side code
area:database    # Data storage
area:api         # API related
area:security    # Security concerns
area:performance # Speed/efficiency
area:accessibility # A11y improvements
```

#### 5. Effort Labels
```bash
effort:xs    # < 1 hour
effort:s     # 1-4 hours  
effort:m     # 1-2 days
effort:l     # 3-5 days
effort:xl    # 1+ weeks
```

### Creating Label Templates

#### Label Configuration File
Create `.github/labels.yml`:
```yaml
# Type labels
- name: "type:bug"
  color: "d73a4a"
  description: "Something isn't working"

- name: "type:feature" 
  color: "a2eeef"
  description: "New feature or request"

- name: "type:enhancement"
  color: "84b6eb"
  description: "Enhancement to existing feature"

# Priority labels
- name: "priority:critical"
  color: "b60205"
  description: "Critical priority"

- name: "priority:high"
  color: "d93f0b"
  description: "High priority"

- name: "priority:medium"
  color: "fbca04"
  description: "Medium priority"

- name: "priority:low"
  color: "0e8a16"
  description: "Low priority"

# Status labels  
- name: "status:blocked"
  color: "000000"
  description: "Blocked and cannot proceed"

- name: "status:in-progress"
  color: "yellow"
  description: "Currently being worked on"

# Area labels
- name: "area:frontend"
  color: "5319e7"
  description: "Frontend related"

- name: "area:backend"
  color: "0052cc"
  description: "Backend related"
```

### Label Management Scripts

#### Bulk Label Creation
```bash
# Using GitHub CLI to create labels
gh label create "type:bug" --color "d73a4a" --description "Something isn't working"
gh label create "type:feature" --color "a2eeef" --description "New feature"
gh label create "priority:high" --color "d93f0b" --description "High priority"

# Batch create from file
# Create labels.txt with format: name|color|description
while IFS='|' read -r name color desc; do
    gh label create "$name" --color "$color" --description "$desc"
done < labels.txt
```

### Label Best Practices

#### 1. Consistent Naming Convention
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Consistent prefix pattern
type:bug, type:feature, type:docs
priority:high, priority:medium, priority:low
area:frontend, area:backend, area:mobile

# ‚ùå Bad: Inconsistent naming
bug, new-feature, documentation  
urgent, normal-priority, low
ui, server, mobile-app
```

#### 2. Color Coding Strategy
```bash
# Use color patterns for recognition
Red tones: Critical issues, bugs
Blue tones: Features, enhancements
Green tones: Low priority, completed
Yellow: Warnings, medium priority
Purple: Areas/components
Gray: Status labels
```

#### 3. Label Automation
```yaml
# .github/workflows/label-automation.yml
name: Auto-label Issues and PRs

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  label:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/labeler@v4
        with:
          configuration-path: .github/labeler.yml
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Create `.github/labeler.yml`:
```yaml
# Add 'area:frontend' label to any changes in frontend directories
area:frontend:
  - 'src/components/**/*'
  - 'src/styles/**/*'
  - 'public/**/*'

# Add 'area:backend' label to API or server changes
area:backend:
  - 'api/**/*'
  - 'server/**/*'
  - 'database/**/*'

# Add 'type:docs' label to documentation changes
type:docs:
  - 'docs/**/*'
  - 'README.md'
  - '**/*.md'
```

### Automated Releases

#### Using GitHub Actions for Releases
```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
name: Create Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Generate Changelog
        id: changelog
        uses: metcalfc/changelog-generator@v4.0.1
        with:
          myToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Create Release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
          body: ${{ steps.changelog.outputs.changelog }}
          draft: false
          prerelease: false

      - name: Build and Upload Assets
        run: |
          # Build your application
          npm run build
          
          # Create zip files
          zip -r release-linux.zip dist/
          
      - name: Upload Release Assets
        uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          upload_url: ${{ steps.create_release.outputs.upload_url }}
          asset_path: ./release-linux.zip
          asset_name: release-linux.zip
          asset_content_type: application/zip
```

#### Semantic Release
```bash
# Install semantic-release
npm install --save-dev semantic-release

# .releaserc.json
{
  "branches": ["main"],
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator", 
    "@semantic-release/changelog",
    "@semantic-release/github",

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Template and Label Strategies

### Multi-Repository Templates

#### Organization-Wide Templates
```bash
# Create .github repository in your organization
# Templates in this repo apply to all repositories

organization/.github/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bug_report.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature_request.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflow-templates/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ci.yml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ci.properties.json
```

#### Template Inheritance
```yaml
# .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml
blank_issues_enabled: false
contact_links:
  - name: Security Issues
    url: https://security.example.com
    about: Report security vulnerabilities privately
  - name: Community Discussion
    url: https://discussions.example.com
    about: Ask questions and discuss ideas
```

### Dynamic Label Assignment

#### Label Automation Rules
```yaml
# .github/workflows/label-management.yml
name: Smart Label Assignment

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited]

jobs:
  assign-labels:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Assign Priority Labels
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            const issue = context.payload.issue || context.payload.pull_request;
            const body = issue.body.toLowerCase();
            
            // Auto-assign priority based on keywords
            if (body.includes('urgent') || body.includes('critical')) {
              await github.rest.issues.addLabels({
                owner: context.repo.owner,
                repo: context.repo.repo,
                issue_number: issue.number,
                labels: ['priority:high']
              });
            }
            
            // Auto-assign type based on title
            if (issue.title.toLowerCase().includes('bug')) {
              await github.rest.issues.addLabels({
                owner: context.repo.owner,
                repo: context.repo.repo,
                issue_number: issue.number,
                labels: ['type:bug']
              });
            }
```
